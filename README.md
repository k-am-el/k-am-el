👋 Hi there, I’m Kamel
I'm at the very beginning of my coding journey — but I'm here to stay.

🚀 What I’m learning now:
HTML & CSS

Git and the command line

Python for simple tools and automation

🎯 My goal:
To become a creative full-stack developer who builds useful, meaningful tools — from scratch.

🛠 What I enjoy:
Solving small problems and digging deep to find answers

Turning ideas into working code

Learning step by step — and sharing what I learn

📚 Recent Project:
I made a simple YouTube video downloader using Python — my first real “it works!” moment.

💡 A quote I like:
"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."

This is mine.

📫 Let’s connect:
I'll be posting my progress on LinkedIn (link coming soon!)
